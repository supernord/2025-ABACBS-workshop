teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
objectives:
- Locate the resources available to support running AlphaFold2 on Setonix.
- Prepare a Nextflow configuration file to utilise available resources.
keypoints:
- Software designed for GPU execution is often compiled for Nvidia GPUS.
- Custom images can be built to support execution using AMD GPUs.
- Container images (Singularity) can be cached in a shared directory to avoid duplication and speed up workflows.

## Setup

- Before commencing the exercise, navigate to the relevant working directory

```bash
cd $MYSCRATCH/2025-ABACBS-workshop/exercises/exercise3/
ls
```

- You should see the following files which will be used in this exercise:

```
abacbs_profile.config  examples  fasta  samplesheet.csv
```

## nf-core/proteinfold
- [proteinfold](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfold/tree/dev) is a Nextflow pipeline designed to support numerous models for molecular structure prediction.
- Today, we will use proteinfold to predict the structure of our uncharacterised protein using the AlphaFold2 model.
- We will use a development branch (commit: 53a1008) to access some of the latest features that are not yet available in the current release.

```bash
#module load nextflow/25.04.6 # This should still be loaded from the previous exercise
nextflow pull nf-core/proteinfold -r 53a1008
```

```bash
tree $NXF_HOME/assets/nf-core/proteinfold/ -L 2 --filelimit=20
```

> ## Setup environment
> - The previous exercise didn’t use containers, but they are one of the most effective ways to manage software in workflow development, especially with Nextflow.
> - In this exercise, we will be using singularity containers and so we need to load the corresponding module on Setonix.
>
> ```bash
> module load singularity/4.1.0-slurm
> ```
> <br>
> > ## **Background:** Why containers?
> >
> > A container is a lightweight, portable environment that bundles an application together with everything it needs to run such as libraries, dependencies, and system tools. It is a simple and reliable alternative to installing software directly on your system or HPC environment (which often requires managing dependencies manually).
> > On HPC systems, this means isolation from other environments, reproducibility across platforms, and simplified maintenance without manual installs or dependency troubleshooting. 
> >
> > It is recommended to pull containers from trusted sources like [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/), [quay.io](quay.io) or [Seqera](https://seqera.io/containers/). During execution, Nextflow automatically pulls required images, often from these repositories, and stores them in the work directory.
> {: .solution} 
>
> - Before executing the workflow, we will define a number of environment variables.
> - These variables tell Nextflow and Singularity where to find and store container images so you don’t waste time and space downloading them repeatedly.
> - **Note: These environment variables need to be set each time you log in to the HPC system (or include them in your job submission script before running Nextflow).**

> - If you execute a Nextflow workflow that requires a container that is not located in the shared `$NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR`, the pipeline will attempt to pull the container from a hosted repository and store the image in your personal `$NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`.
>
> > ## **Background:** Why Environment Variables?
> > When using containers on HPC systems, Nextflow needs to know where to store and retrieve container images. By default, it downloads containers into the workflow’s `work/` directory, which can be inefficient and waste storage if you run multiple workflows.
> >
> > Setting environment variables allows you to:
> > - Cache container images in a shared location → Avoid repeated downloads and speed up execution.
> > - Control storage paths → Prevent filling up your home directory or job scratch space.
> > - Ensure reproducibility → Use the same cached image across multiple runs and workflows.

## AMD-compatible images
- The proteinfold workflow includes several modules that are executed on the GPU. 
- Default containers [hosted](https://quay.io/organization/nf-core) by the nf-core organisation support Nvidia hardware and will not run on the Setonix AMD gpus. 
- Pawsey provides a number of AMD-compatible [containers](https://quay.io/organization/pawsey) which can be used to run structure prediction models. 
- Pre-built images have been provided for the workshop today at `/scratch/references/abacbs2025/containers`. 
- We can configure the workflow to use these non-standard images by defining their path in a custom Nextflow config.

> ## Note
> - Normally AlphaFold2 runs 5 different models and picks the best result.
> - Today we are using a modified version of AlphaFold2 that only runs a single model to reduce execution time.
{: .prereq}

Check the `abacbs_workshop.config` file to confirm that the workflow modules are configured to use non-standard images available on Setonix.

```bash
grep -w RUN_ALPHAFOLD2 abacbs_profile.config -A3
```

output:
```
withName: 'RUN_ALPHAFOLD2' {
    container = '/scratch/references/abacbs2025/containers/alphafold2-single.sif'
    time = { 12.h }
}
```

## Reference data
- Recall that structure prediction relies on collecting homologous proteins in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to identify coevolutionary information.
- These homologs are identified from enormous reference sequence databases (>1TB).
- Check that these databases are available on Setonix.

```bash
tree /scratch/references/abacbs2025/databases/
```

You should see that the required AlphaFold2 databases and model parameters are available here.

```

    ├── mgnify
    ├── pdb70
    ├── pdb_mmcif
    ├── pdb_seqres
    ├── small_bfd
    ├── uniprot
    └── uniref90 
```

> ## Note
> - Today, we are using miniature versions of the databases to reduce execution time for the purpose of the workshop. 
> - These databases will **NOT** generate high-quality predictions for other protein targets. 
> - Full size databases are available at `/scratch/references/alphafold_feb2024/databases/`.
